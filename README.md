# DuckHunt 2020: An Augmented Adventure
DuckHunt 2020 was created by Brandyn Reindel, as the final portfolio project for Holberton School's AR/VR Specialization. Built as an homage to the 1984 Nintendo classic, one of the first video games to change the perception on how players can interact with a game. DuckHunt 2020 brings the classic sounds, reminiscent aesthetics, and familiar gameplay into the 21st Century.

DuckHunt2020 is a full functional Augmented Reality 'Duck Hunt'-like experience. Complete with an intro menu, sound effects, visual effects, immersive augmented reality, infinite score counter and rounds, and even an easter egg with another game hidden inside this early build.

## Things to Come
This will be an on going project to further expand the possibilities of casual free-play AR Games and my own technical development. I invite you to save this repo, get **[in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandyn-reindel-372b57102/)**, and **[follow me](https://twitter.com/Optimus_is_Me)**. 

But most importantly, keep your eye for these features in future builds:

- A High Score System
- 2 Player Mode (Co-op and V.S.)
   - A future build could see the ability to play with friends as you help each other reach new high scores.
   - Or better yet challenge someone to little friendly competition.
- Updated Terrain and Assets/Artwork
- More Levels
- More Game Modes (Time Attack, Target Challenge, Stay tuned to find out)
- More Easter Eggs......have you found any yet?

In the future I plan on implementing the Vuforia Object Scanner app (if I can get the APK working correctly), or Vuforia Area Target Creator App with a LiDAR enabled device. With this I plan on using a real world object like a rubber duck as the Image Target that sets the game to render, rather than a static image.  

# Original Project Guidelines

## Requirements

Requirements for our portfolio project were fairly minimal in the sense that we able to pitch, plan, and build any AR, VR, or game related idea we could come up with. However, this portfolio project is the culmination of a 2 year software engineering program and was expected to reflect that. Therefore all projects were submitted with a written proposal and needed to be approved of beforehand.

## How to Play
- Print the target image from the repo
- Once the app is installed on your device, scan until you have located the printed target image. The game should appear.
- Click on the dog to begin Round 1.
- Move your phone or your body around the printed image target searching for ducks.
- Click the red bullseye in the bottom right corner to fire.
 
## Rules
- You have 3 shots to hit a duck.
- If you miss 3 times, you lose a life.
- You only have 2 lives!
- Each time you successfully hit a duck (oh you'll know!) your bullets will replenish back to 3.
- Should you lose both lives you will be given the option to restart at Round 1, or quit.

## Technologies
DuckHunt 2020 was built in Unity3D 2019.4.17f1 and Visual Studio Code in conjunction with the latest Vuforia API release. All assets were free, the majority of which came directly from the Unity Asset Store.
