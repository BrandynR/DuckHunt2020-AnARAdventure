# DuckHunt 2020: An Augmented Adventure

DuckHunt 2020 was created by **[Brandyn Reindel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandyn-reindel-372b57102/)**, as the final portfolio project for Holberton School's AR/VR Specialization. Built as an homage to the 1984 Nintendo classic, one of the first video games to change the perception on how players can interact with a game, and a personal favorite growing up. DuckHunt 2020 brings the classic sounds, reminiscent aesthetics, and familiar gameplay into the 21st Century.

  

DuckHunt2020 is a casual free-play, fully functional, Augmented Reality 'Duck Hunt'-like experience. Complete with an intro menu, sound effects, particle systems, immersive augmented reality, infinite score counter and rounds, the ability to replenish ammunition and even an easter egg with another game hidden inside. This early build, although just a proof of concept at this point, is a stepping stone to something truly great!

  

## Things to Come...

This will be an on going project to further expand the possibilities of casual free-play Augmented Reality Games and my own technical development. I invite you to save **[this repo](https://github.com/BrandynR/DuckHunt2020-AnARAdventure)**, get **[in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandyn-reindel-372b57102/)**, and **[follow me](https://twitter.com/Optimus_is_Me)**.

  

But most importantly, keep your eye for these features in future builds:

  

- A High Score System in place.

- 2 Player Mode (Co-op and V.S.)

   - A future build could see the ability to play with friends as you help each other reach new high scores.

   - Or better yet challenge someone to a little friendly competition.

- Updated Terrain and Assets/Artwork.

- More Levels

- That's a given!

- More Game Modes (Time Attack, Target Challenge, Stay tuned to find out)

- More Easter Eggs......have you found any yet?
(Hint in the picture at the bottom)

In the future I plan on implementing the Vuforia Object Scanner app (if I can get the APK working correctly), or Vuforia Area Target Creator App with a LiDAR enabled device. With this I plan on using a real world 3D object like a rubber duck as the Image Target that sets the game to render, rather than a static image. Making DuckHunt2020 accessable to far more people and streamlining the intital setup.

  

# Original Project Guidelines

  

## Requirements

  

Requirements for our portfolio project were fairly minimal in the sense that we able to pitch, plan, and build any AR, VR, or game related idea we could come up with. However, this portfolio project is the culmination of a 2 year software engineering program and was expected to reflect that. Therefore all projects were submitted with a written proposal and needed to be approved of beforehand.

  

## How to Play

- Print the target image from the repo

- Once the app is installed on your device, scan until you have located the printed target image. The game should appear.

- Click on the dog to begin Round 1.

- Move your phone or your body around the printed image target searching for ducks.

- Click the red bullseye in the bottom right corner to fire.

## Rules

- You have 3 shots to hit a duck.

- If you miss 3 times, you lose a life.

- You only have 2 lives!

- Each time you successfully hit a duck (oh you'll know!) your bullets will replenish back to 3.

- Should you lose both lives you will be given the option to restart at Round 1, or quit.

  

## Technologies

DuckHunt 2020 was built in Unity3D 2019.4.17f1 and Visual Studio Code in conjunction with the latest Vuforia API release. All assets were free, the majority of which came directly from the Unity Asset Store.

### Including:

- #### Low Poly Tree Pack from Broken Vector https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/low-poly-tree-pack-57866

- #### Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack from JustCreate https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-simple-nature-pack-162153

- #### LowPoly Water from Ebru Dogan https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/lowpoly-water-107563

- ### Simple Low Poly Nature Pack from NeutronCat https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/simple-low-poly-nature-pack-15755

- #### Mobile depth water shader from Valakh Pavel https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/mobile-depth-water-shader-89541

- #### Low Poly Free Vegetation Pack from Catalin Pavel https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-free-vegetation-pack-176906rse

And of course this project wouldn't be possible with the endless Google searches, talking with peers, available free resources, and different Unity forums. Thank you to everyone!

  
## Testing and Debugging
- Primary Debugging was handled through the Unity3D Editor in conjunction with Visual Studio Code.
- Primary Testing was done on a Samsung Galaxy S9+.
- Built in Unity3D 2019.4.17f1 and Visual Studio Code
on a 2019 MacBook Pro.

## Developer
![](https://i.imgur.com/Unn435I.png)
- **[Brandyn Reindel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandyn-reindel-372b57102/)** was the sole designer, programmer, and creative lead.
Who Am I?
   - I’m a software engineer and game developer and this project marks the completion of my Second Year Specialization in AR/VR at Holberton School New Haven. Currently I am working on developing an augmented reality mobile app “Tetris IRL”. It’s a 3D Tetris style game that lets the user put play and interact with the game pieces in the world around them. As a software engineering I am most fluent in Unity and C#, which is a direct result of my passion for AR,VR, and video games and the technologies used to create them. Please don't hesitate to reach out!
